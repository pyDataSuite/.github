# Welcome to the **pyDataSuite** organization! 
The tools contained in this organization have the singular purpose of increasing the quality of data analysis and presentation everywhere.

## Application
The unique aspect of pyDataSuite is that it is built on yesterday's technology. The only dependencies for anything in this organization include python3.6 and Anaconda3-4.4.0. The entire organization, save for the sample data, is made up of plain-text files. The benefit to this approach is that this software should function in even the strictest of corporate environments, where the technologies of today won't exist for another couple years.

## Dependencies
This organization is restricted to using the python interpreter and accompanying packages in [Anaconda3-4.4.0](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/). That link will take you to a page where you can download and install older versions of Anaconda.

Also, due to security concerns, the use of pyqt5 is very strongly not encouraged because of potential security issues.

To see the python libraries available in Anaconda3-4.4.0, please [visit this link.](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/old-pkg-lists/4.4.0/py36/)
